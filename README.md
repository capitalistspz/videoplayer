Attempt at a video player on the Wii U.

Requirements:
- devkitPPC
- [wut](https://github.com/devkitPro/wut)
- [CafeGLSL](https://github.com/Exzap/CafeGLSL) for shader compilation
- [bento4/ap4](https://github.com/axiomatic-systems/Bento4) for reading from MP4 files. Specifically uses this [fork](https://github.com/capitalistspz/Bento4/tree/ppcdef) because a macro is not set correctly.
